thought for the site

site to help with english learning for students
similar to duolingo basically

stack
    front - react
    back - java
    framework - spring boot
    sql database
    styling components - bootstrap or MUI


--------------------------------
UNAUTHENTICATED PAGES

    first page/ home page
        just an overview of the site, what there is on it
        nav bar at the top to show all the links
            includes login button

    login
        basic login page > goes to dashboard

    registration
        first time for a user > register > dashboard

AUTHENTICATED PAGES

    dashboard (first page upon logging in)

    nav bar:
        Learn
        Practice

        Profile
            global rank
            total tasks completed
            achievements
        Leaderboards
            this will show global, weekly/monthly leaderboards

        ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF ALL PAGES when browsing
        so except inside test, module or profile
            Leaderboards Rank
            Recent Achievements 
            About (link under these ^)
			Contact (link under these ^)
			
			(check duolingo how it does it)
			

    Learn
        learn will have module blocks like Rosetta Stone
        can go through each one by one and choose which to do

        separated into easy medium hard module blocks

        user can only access medium if they complete "Easy Test" (we determine this by if the user has achieved a badge?)

        can only access hard by medium etc.

        this will have some theory in it, some slides maybe, examples
        and then a multiple choice at the end
            here score doesnt count
            but its 5 random questions
            after answering each Q, it will show which is right/wrong
            with explanation

        xp gained for completing and going through module (not a lot)

        each page on module is time gated, e.g. 10s minimum per page (like i did on waveaccess modules)
        5xp for module completed
            5 for easy, 10 for medium, 15 for hard?

    Practice
        here we will have 2 sections
		maybe 2 tabs at the top? (Practice (or some similar name) and Tests (or similar name for official tests)
		FEEDBACK WILL BE GIVEN AFTER EACH TEST AS TO WHICH WAS THE CORRECT ANSWER AND WHY!
		
            one section for general pratice and repeated practice, user can do multiple tests
                stuff like grammar, maybe multiple choice stuff here
                choose from big section of tests
				
				maybe easy/medium/hard split  up like in modules
				and under each difficulty have multiple modules e.g.
				
				Easy
					Say Hello
					What to order in a Cafe
					...
					...
				Medium
					Going on holiday
					...
					
				(similar here to Duolingo scroll down tests) ^
					

            second section are the "official" easy/medium/hard tests
			these will have official names and difficulties e.g.
			Easy
				Grammar
				Spelling and Punctuation
				Multiple Choice
			Medium 
				Grammar
				Spelling and Punctuation
				Multiple Choice
			Hard
				...
				
			TO GET THE EASY BADGE, (aka to go onto medium modules), NEED TO COMPLETE AND GET 80% OR ABOVE IN ALL EASY TESTS
			
			this will be lets say 10 questions? and pass mark is 8/10 or so
                can take multiple times when needed
                but the data bank for this has to be HUGE, so there is low chance to get the same questions
                

    Profile
        user's profile
        it has name
        global rank (button to the leaderboards)
        total tasks completed
        log off button
        Achievements (view all button) (show recent 5 only)

        Profile/achievements
            will open up all achievments the user has earned
            will show what the user has not earned yet (greyed out) with progress bar

    Leaderboards
        tabs for weekly, monthly, all time leaderboard
        shows top 20, and if someone's rank is below 20
            then will show ... and #35 below that as an example

        RANK USERNAME XP

        top 1-3 will have badge next to them




--------------------------------
potential ideas

    nav bar on left side going down like in duolingo
        Learn


    achievements/badges system

    we have learning modules that the user goes through, can scroll down
    3 difficulties

    cant access medium modules till easy test is completed
    cant do hard till medium etc. etc.


duolingo 
    nav bar on side
        learn
        practice
        leaderboards
        quests
        shop 
        profile 
        more
    middle container = choose lesson (while on learn)
        basically content for that tab
    right container
        adds, daily quests etc.

    i like the idea of the profile / language (in my case difficulty) on the far side of the nav bar

    and the tabs, app name on the near side


rosetta stone
    has a learn and extended learning section
    https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wypSpDHhETg/maxresdefault.jpg

    this is nice i think
